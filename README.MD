Using the [TailPress](https://github.com/jeffreyvr/tailpress) boilerplate theme to recreate the [github.blog](https://github.blog) site.

## Getting started
* Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/jeffreyvr/thegithubblog.git && cd thegithubblog`
* Run `rm -rf .git` to remove git
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run development`
* Run `npm run watch` to start developing

You will find the editable CSS and Javascript files within the `/resources` folder.

## Block editor support
TailPress comes with basic support for the [block editor](https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-editor/).

CSS-classes for alignment, background and text colors will be generated automatically. You can modify this within the `tailwind.config.js` file.

To make the editing experience within the block editor more in line with the front end styling, a `editor-style.css` is generated.

### Define theme colors
Four colors (primary, secondary, dark and light) are defined from the beginning. You can modify the colors in `tailpress.json`.

### Define theme font sizes
You can modify the font sizes within `tailpress.json`.

## PurgeCSS
By default, PurgeCSS is enabled. You can modify or disable it by changing the settings in the `tailwind.config.js` file. There are several [PurgeCSS options](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#purge-css-options).
